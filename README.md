## Mock API Implementation

Per the challenge's pro tips, this application uses a mock backend to ensure functionality and stability. The API calls to a live AI service have been replaced with a placeholder that simulates a 5-second processing time and returns a sample video. This guarantees the application is fully functional end-to-end.

## Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Set up the backend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend folder and create a virtual environment
    cd backend
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install Python dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Run the Flask server
    python app.py
    ```

3.  **Set up the frontend:**
    ```bash
    # Open a new terminal and navigate to the client folder
    cd client

    # Install Node.js dependencies
    npm install
